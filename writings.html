Love;
The feeling he had for her
Love,
That he ignored
Love,
The feeling she had for another.
Love,
That they ignored
Love,
That turned absurd
Love,
Treated as an abide
Love,
A promise not to fall for again
Love,
That made them apart.
Love,
That was never confessed.
Love,

Are there days when you want to just chill and do nothing. You look for a good movie and try to chill. By the time you change the movie for the fourth time and finally watching one, you are lost!

Are there days when you want to read a pending book, you start but it's already an hour you're on the first page.

Are there days when you are listening to your favorite playlist and you've reached the last song.

Are there days you feel lost but you find the real you?

Are there days where you want to meet your friends but be alone as well?

Are there days when you want to share your thoughts but keep quiet instead.

I have. I realized that I did want to watch a movie, I want to gaze the stars.
I don't want to read a book but write a story if my own.
I don't to listen to the song, I want to change the lyrics of myself.
I don't want to lose myself but find myself.
I have days where I want to be alone but not lonely.
I have days where I type long messages but keep it in the draft.
And trust me, that's ok. ðŸ–¤

Damn! All those butterflies
All the promises we made were never lies
Growing old together, how the time flies
Cups of coffee and some fries
How we looked at each other in the eyes
Looking back on how we walked all those miles
All the memories that I try to memorize
Damn, it still gives me butterflies

        <h3>Bubble</h3>
        <button class="read-more-btn">Read More</button>
        <div class="writing-content">
          <pre>
Lately I realized that sometimes when you let someone in your bubble it's not that bad. You get to stay in a bigger and happier bubble. Is it good to be an open book once in a while? I am scared because people might just lose interest after reading you for a while and the pages remain unturned. It is never about the next chapter it's about the effort and time you invest in that person to turn the pages, the person becomes a part of it too.

People that enter our life happen to be a character in a chapter but why not the whole book? Why does the journey start and never end? And that hurts because you make stories about them and one day they disappear and you're not sure if you are to stop or continue without that person. And it again takes me to the part where I want to be in the bubble all by myself. It kind of sucks when it's your book but someone else is writing the story.

You sometimes don't have a name for few a relationships and maybe that's awesome because you vibe with that person, you feel good talking to them. You've just started talking, never met but you trust them and they trust you too. You can be you and there are no commitments. They unintentionally play an important part in your life and you're not sure if they're meant to stay or one day they disappear.

Out of the seven billions
I want some to forever be mine
Mine, as sweet as the old wine
Ones that make my dark days shine
Ones to know, when I'm not fine
Playing around and making silly rhymes
We'd be there in all thick and thin times
We'd go crazy and sometimes fine dine
Smile in my happiness like the wind chime
Just not friends, they'd be my lifeline
Ones I can call in the midnight or nine
Out of the seven billions
Always be mine.

Questions to the sky
Dear sky,
Why is staring at you a craze?
Why are you so peaceful after a gaze.
How do you heal the soul that was a raze.
How does your patterns have so much to say?
How does the cloud make you stay.
How do you make me smile in my worst day.
So beautiful to see the sun rise
How soothing is it for the eye
Be it glimpse of you with the moon
or your dark side in the monsoon
and when you pour some rain
how do you wash away all my pain
why the glance of you such an amaze
is staring at you really a craze?
